## Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a collection of scripts and data for analyzing and visualizing various types of data. The scripts and markdown files in this repository focus on different types of data, including geospatial data, network data, discrete and numerical data, and time series data.

The repository includes several scripts for creating visualizations, such as "Visualization of network data and time series.r", "Visualization of discrete and numerical data.r" and "Analysis and visualization of geospatial data.r". These scripts can be used to create informative and visually appealing plots for a variety of data types.

The repository also includes several CSV files containing sample data, such as 'CARS_1.csv', 'geoMap.csv', 'geoMapukr.csv', 'migration.csv', and 'multiTimeline.csv'. These data files can be used to test and experiment with the different visualization scripts in the repository.

The 'spatial vizs.md' file provides an overview of the different types of visualizations that can be created using the scripts and data in this repository.

Feel free to use and modify these scripts and data for your own projects, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback!
